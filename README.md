Objective:
To understand Amazon user behavior by analyzing products with high review counts and frequent user interactions, differentiating between behaviors of frequent and infrequent viewers, and interpreting review features for both groups.

Methodology:
1. Data Collection and Preparation:
   - Extracted extensive user and product review data from Amazon.
   - Cleaned and preprocessed data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

2. Analysis and Visualization:
   - Identifying High-Review Products:
     - Executed a comprehensive analysis to pinpoint products with the highest number of reviews and most frequent user interactions.
     - Utilized a grouped bar chart to visually represent and highlight these top-reviewed products, enabling clear identification of popular items.
   - Behavioral Analysis:
     - Distinguished between the behaviors of frequent viewers and infrequent viewers.
     - Analyzed differences in viewing patterns, purchase behavior, and review activity between these two user groups.
   - Review Feature Analysis:
     - Investigated review features for both frequent and non-frequent users.
     - Applied box plot visualizations to illustrate the distribution and variance in review ratings, providing insights into user satisfaction and engagement levels.

Findings:
- Products with a high number of reviews were often linked to higher user interaction frequencies, suggesting a correlation between product popularity and user engagement.
- Frequent viewers demonstrated different behavior patterns compared to infrequent viewers, including higher review submission rates and more detailed feedback.
- Review features varied significantly between frequent and non-frequent users, with frequent users providing more consistent and higher-quality reviews.

Conclusion:
The analysis provided valuable insights into Amazon user behavior, revealing key factors that influence product reviews and user engagement. These findings can inform strategies to enhance customer experience and optimize product offerings.

Tools and Technologies Used:
- Python for data analysis and visualization (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).
